The LabView Resource File (RSRC) is a container used for both Virtual Instruments (VI) files, and LabView Library (LLB) files. Inside the RSRC container, various blocks are stored.

Typically the file consists of two RSRC chunks, where first contains the actual data of each block, and second contains metadata with information on where each block is located inside the first chunk.
